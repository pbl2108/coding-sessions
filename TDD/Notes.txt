PART I
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TDD cycle
* Add a little test
* Run all tests and fail 
* Make a change
* Run tests and succeed
* Refactor to remove duplication

TDD best practices: 
* The three approaches to makeing a test work cleanly: 
	Fake it. Triangulation. Obvious Implementation. 
* Removing duplication between test and code as a way to drive the design 
* The ability to control the gap between the tests to increase traction when the road gets slippery and cruise faster when conditions are clear
